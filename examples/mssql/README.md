MsSQL Example
=============


[MSSQL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2016) lets you build intelligent, mission-critical applications using a scalable, hybrid database platform that has everything built inâ€”from in-memory performance and advanced security to in-database analytics. You can easily add it to your Lando app by adding an entry to the `services` key in your app's `.lando.yml`.

Supported versions
------------------

*   [latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/mssql-server-linux/)
*   custom

> #### Warning::YOU MUST BOOST YOUR RAM TO USE THIS SERVICE
>
> MSSQL currently requires 4GB of RAM to run, which is above the 2GB default set by Docker. To boost your ram please check out: https://github.com/Microsoft/mssql-docker/issues/114

Using patch versions
--------------------

Because we use a third-party `mssql` image specifying a patch version is not currently supported. If you need to use a patch version you might be able to use our [advanced service config](https://docs.devwithlando.io/config/advanced.html).

Example
-------


You will need to rebuild your app with `lando rebuild` to apply the changes to this file. You can check out the full code for this example [over here](https://github.com/lando/lando/tree/master/examples/mssql).

Getting information
-------------------

You can get connection and credential information about your database by running `lando info` from inside your app.

```bash
# Navigate to the app
cd /path/to/app

# Get info (app needs to be running to get this)
lando info

{
  "html": {
    "type": "nginx",
    "version": "latest",
    "webroot": "www",
    "urls": [
      "http://localhost:32774",
      "http://mssql.lndo.site",
      "https://mssql.lndo.site"
    ]
  },
  "database": {
    "type": "mssql",
    "version": "latest",
    "creds": {
      "user": "sa",
      "password": "he11oTHERE"
    },
    "internal_connection": {
      "host": "database",
      "port": 1443
    },
    "external_connection": {
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": "1434"
    }
  }
}
```


This example provides a very basic `mssql` service.

See the `.lando.yml` in this directory for `mssql` configuration options.

Getting Started
---------------

You should be able to run the following steps to get up and running with this example.

You will likely need to increase the default memory requirements of your docker host in order to run this service. If you are unsure whether you have enough memory run `lando logs -s database | grep 3250` and if you get a response, increase your memory and then `lando restart`.

```bash
# Start up the example
lando start

# Check out other commands you can use with this example
lando
```

Helpful Commands
----------------

Here is a non-exhaustive list of commands that are relevant to this example.

```bash
# Get DB connection info
lando info

# Drop into a DB shell
lando sqlcmd -U sa -H database -P he11oTHERE

# Run bcp commands
lando bcp
```
