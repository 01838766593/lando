  appserver:

    # Ruby
    type: ruby

    # Optionally create certs in /certs that can be used by your application
    # to listen over https. Creates the following certs your app can use
    #
    #   - /certs/cert.key
    #   - /certs/cert.crt
    #   - /certs/cert.pem
    #
    # ssl: true

    # Optionally specify a command/script to run when you start your ruby service up.
    #
    # If you are using ruby as a server you are going to want to define this.
    # This can be either a string or array.
    #
    # If you are just spinning up a ruby container for usage as a cli tool
    # you can leave this blank and the container will boot up and stay on
    #
    # You will likely want to run needed build steps eg `lando bundler install`
    # first so needed dependencies are installed before your server starts up.
