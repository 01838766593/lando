    # List of services that we want to capture mail from
    # You can run `lando info` to get a list of services that are available
    # Mailhog expects that these services will be php services

    # Optionally allow access to the smtp service at localhost:1026
    # You will need to make sure port 1026 is open on your machine
    #
    # You can also set `portforward: true` to have Lando dynamically assign
    # an open port. Unlike specifying an actual port setting this to true will give you
    # a different port every time you restart your app
    portforward: 1026
  # Add a php to help with this example
