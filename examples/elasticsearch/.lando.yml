# Give me http://elasticsearch.lndo.site
proxy:

    - port: 80/tcp
      default: true

# Spin up a basic nodes server with elasticsearch backend
services:

  # Spin up a memcache container called "search"
  # NOTE: "search" is arbitrary, you could just as well call this "theboss" or "eljefe"
  search:

    # Use version 5.4 of elasticsearch
    type: elasticsearch:5.4

    # Optionally allow access to the cache at localhost:9999
    # You will need to make sure port 9999 is open on your machine
    #
    # You can also set `portforward: true` to have Lando dynamically assign
    # a port. Unlike specifying an actual port setting this to true will give you
    # a different port every time you restart your app
    portforward: 9999

  # Spin up services to run a basic node server
  appserver:
    type: node:6.10
    command: npm start
    build:
      - "cd $LANDO_MOUNT & npm install"

# Add some nice command routing
tooling:
  npm:
    service: appserver
  gulp:
    service: appserver
  node:
    service: appserver
