# The name of the app
name: postgres

# Service configuration
services:

  # Spin up a postgres container called "tswift"
  tswift:

    # Use the latest version of postgres
    type: postgres

    # Optionally allow access to the database at localhost:3307
    # You will need to make sure port 3307 is open on your machine
    #
    # You can also set `portforward: true` to have Lando dynamically assign
    # a port. Unlike specifying an actual port setting this to true will give you
    # a different port every time you restart your app
    portforward: 5444

    # Optionally set the default db credentials
    #
    # Note: You will need to `lando destroy && lando start` to change these if you've
    # already started your app
    # See: https://docs.devwithlando.io/tutorials/lando-info.html
    creds:
      database: trouble

    # Optionally load in all the postgres config files into the config directory
    # This is relative to the app root
    # NOTE: these files need to end in .conf
    # config:
    #   config: config/mythings.conf
