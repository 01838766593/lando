# Community

Lando has a robust community of over 1,000 developers helping each other out. Here are a few of the best places to engage with them.

## GitHub issue queue

To report a bug or submit a feature request we'd encourage you to check out the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues).

## Slack

To engage directly with other users, get help, ask general questions or get advice we'd encourage you to join the [Lando slack channel](https://launchpass.com/devwithlando).

That said, Slack fatigue is a thing so it may make more sense to join a `#lando` channel in a Slack org you already belong too. Here are some more common `#lando` channels in other orgs.
