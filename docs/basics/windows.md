# Windows

::: warning YOU MUST HAVE HYPER-V ENABLED
Make sure that [Hyper-V is enabled](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyperv_on_windows/quick_start/walkthrough_install) or lando will not work!
:::

::: tip Do not fear the package size!
Note that our Windows installer _includes_ Docker Desktop and this accounts for it's large file size in comparison to our Linux packages. When going through the installer you can choose to _not_ install Docker Desktop, although we recommend you use the version of Docker Desktop that we ship for compatibility and support reasons!
:::

1.  Make sure you are using **at least** Windows 10 Professional with the latest updates installed.
2.  Download the latest Windows `.exe` installer from [GitHub](https://github.com/lando/lando/releases)
3.  Double-click on `lando.exe`
4.  Go through the setup workflow
5.  Approve various UAC prompts during install
