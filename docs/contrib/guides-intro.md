# Getting Started Writing Guides

**So you wanna to write a guide?** Holla! That's great because it's not very hard!

::: warning Make sure you activate Secret Toggle!!!
These docs assume you've [installed Lando from source](./activate.md), [toggled its Secret Toggle](./activate.md), [added yourself as a contributor](./first.md) and generally gotten up to speed with [contributing in general](./contributing.md)
:::

## What is a guide?

On the highest level a guide should answer a very specific technical question such as

> _How do I run Drupal 4.6 using Lando?_

This differs from the other documentation which is declarative and reads more like a technical manual and our blog which is for higher level, less technical content like case studies.

Good guides should...

* Address _**only one**_ hyperspecific thing
* Be short and concise, like a glorified gist
* Revolve around code snippets, config or commands
* Show up as the first Google result
* Have complete and working source code in a repo

Here are titles for some good guides...

* _Running Drupal 4.6 in Lando_
* _Using Patternlab and Lando_
* _Getting a Lando proxy URL for the SOLR 7 web UI_
* _Setting up a custom Chromedriver service in Lando_

And titles for some things that might be better as blog posts or general documentation

* _10 Reasons Lando is the Best Thing Ever_
* _Saving time and money with Lando_
* _Drupal 9 Lando Recipe_
* _Lando Tooling_

## What do I need to get started?
