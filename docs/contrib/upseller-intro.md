# Convince Your Company to Sponsor

The Lando revolution relies upon new converts. You've probably already told some of your co-workers and friends to try Lando. Maybe you've [written some guides](./guides-intro.md) and [sponsored Lando yourself](./sponsor-intro.md). What's the next step?

## Becoming an Upseller

To become an upseller...

1. [Register for the Lando Alliance](https://lando.dev/alliance/join), making sure to check the box next to "Upseller".

2. [Fill out the Lando contact form](https://lando.dev/contact/), telling us about the organization you think should sponsor Lando.

We'll get in touch with you to help you convince your organization to sponsor.

## Why Ask Your Organization to Sponsor Lando?

If you and your team are saving development time using Lando, your organization is already receiving dividends from the bank of Lando. Instead of each developer on your team paying part of their paycheck to sponsor, shouldn't your organization invest back to make sure the Lando royalties keep getting dished out?

Asking your boss to sponsor Lando might seem tough. Why should they pay for something they're already getting for free?

## Sponsorship Benefit Talking Points

If you're already talking to your boss, financial officer, or whoever has the pursestrings at your company about Lando sponsorship, here are a few talking points that might help you convince them to sponsor Lando:

### Marketing + Hiring Benefits

By sponsoring Lando, a network of over 10K developers will see your logo on the Lando website, docs, and our social media posts. Those developers primarily work in Drupal, WordPress, Laravel, and Javascript. Since they use Lando, you know they're professional developers, many of whom are looking for their next position.

For less than the price of a single job posting, you can get 10K pairs of eyes from qualified prospective hires!

### Keep Enjoying Boosted Productivity.

Lando may be free to use, but it's not valueless. If your team is already using Lando, chances are you're saving dozens of developer hours each month. By paying a small fraction of that you can ensure that Lando continues to save your team time so they can produce more features in less time (and stay sane doing it).

### Say "Thank You" To Your Team

Let your developers feel good about giving back to a project that they use and get them access to Lando perks like swag, exclusive content, and events.
