# Sponsor Lando

## Why Sponsor Lando

Lando is free and open source, but freedom isn't free in the land of brave and home of the Lando. Thousands of man hours have gone into creating Lando, and hundreds more are spent each year.

By sponsoring Lando with your hard earned American dollars, the Lando team can...

- Fix bugs
- Pay for hosting/bug monitoring
- Develop new features
- Create how-tos and Lando documentation
- Allow @pirog to see the light of day

Every sponsorship dollar helps Lando get better!

## How to Sponsor

Sponsorship is the easiest contribution method; just register on one of our sponsorship platform accounts and start helping Lando!

Github Sponsors, Patreon, and Open Collective: all three of these official Lando sponsorship methods are valid, but each comes with its own transaction fees and caveats. Broadly speaking, we've adjusted the sponsorship amount to account for transaction fees.

### [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/lando) (**preferred**)

[Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/lando) is the best way to sponsor Lando for the following reasons:

**Lowest Sponsorship Amount**: Github Sponsors doesn't charge a transaction fee right now, so all your sponsorship $$$ helps Lando!
**2X Matching**: Github Sponsors will match all sponsorship dollars up to $5,000 in the first year. Your cash goes further!

### [Patreon](https://patreon.com/devwithlando)

The gold standard of sponsoring creatives, [Patreon](https://patreon.com/devwithlando) does charge a transactional fee, hence why you'll see sponsorship rates are a little higher there. Rest assured that Lando gets the same amount, but all things being equal you might want to use Github Sponsors instead.

### [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/devwithlando)

[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/devwithlando) has similar drawbacks to Patreon, _however_, it may allow us to redistribute funds to projects Lando relies upon and other contributors in the future. If you're a devotee to the Open Collective ethos, give her, otherwise, Github Sponsors!
