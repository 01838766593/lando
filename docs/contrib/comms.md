# 3. Join the Comms

Project collaboration happens primarily on [GitHub](https://github.com) or [Slack](https://slack.com/).

## GitHub

GitHub serves as the mechanism for all Lando code, issue reporting/tracking and project management.

The [Lando Organization](https://github.com/lando) is the starting point for all Lando projects. That said most collaboration is going to occur in the core [Lando Project](https://github.com/lando/lando) and its [issue queue](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues).

It you are a contributor it is **highly recommended** you also install [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/extension) to get access to a nice Kanban style board for the GitHub issues.

## Slack

Slack serves as the mechanism for Lando support and contributor coordination. You can join the Lando slack org via [LaunchPass](https://launchpass.com/devwithlando) and it has the following channels you can join

  * **#community** - For Lando community support
  * **#kalabox** - For legacy Kalabox community support
  * **#contributors** - For all Lando contributors
  * **#events** - For users looking to evangelize the project at meetups, events, camps, etc

Join a channel and say hi!
