    Time is wasted and quality suffers when there is no agreed-upon process for
    onboarding new developers into a project, running project tests (you wrote

    We often think of DevOps in a siloed context (eg one project at a time), but
    having an organizational DevOps plan/strategy and some cross project
    standardization is really how you benefit. This talk is about the business
    value of horizontal DevOps across people and projects.
