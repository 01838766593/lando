I think the lack of other

* Give some value back
* Help us staff support, save more time, scope of questions we answer increase with size of sponsorships dollars
* Get yearly sweet swag and help spread the word
* Help us compensate devs, evangelist, etc
* Help us pay for infrastructure

### 1. The Business Reason

If it saves you time and money return a small percentage of that.

### 2. The Relationship Reason

Every year we will send a surprise swag benefit. not only will this make you cool, it will also help us market and spread the word.

### 3. The Financial Reason

It costs money to run lando

## Conclusion

If everyone who uses Lando sponsored at the $4 level.

* Giving back value
* Getting support
