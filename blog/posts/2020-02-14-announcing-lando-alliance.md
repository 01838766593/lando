It's a little hard to believe that we've been building free and open source developer tools for almost 10 years now!

I still remember the reaction the first time I demoed Kalabox 1 at the East Bay Drupal Users Group in 2012. People were like NO WAY! WHAT IS THIS NEW DEVILRY? I also remember the excitement when we successfully closed our Kickstarter for Kalabox 2 in 2014 and the subsequent relief when we finally released it later in 2016. More recently, I remember feeling the undeniable love energy when Lando surpassed 10,000 active monthly users, almost 10x more than we'd ever had in any iteration of Kalabox.

Throughout this journey, however, we'd often be asked about the business side of our free and open source developer tool ambitions. The collective attitude of these people towards our work was perhaps best encapsulated as:

> That's cool bro, but what's the business model?

And totally fair enough! I mean, afterall, we _were_ a business and we _were_ spending non-trivial amounts of time and money. _Shouldn't we have a business model?_ _**SHOULDN'T WE?**_

I must admit that I struggled to find an answer that was satisfactory to the asker the first few times. Afterwards, I remember feeling some combination of sheepishness and shame, mixed with a healthy dose of imposter syndrome. Over time I got marginally better at responding but after maybe the hundreth ask I just sort of accepted the implied premise: _We need a business model!_

## Searching, searching, always searching

Unbeknownst to us at the time but the Kickstarter we launched for Kalabox 2 in 2014 was probably our first attempt to find a "busines model". While it _did_ confirm that _some_ people were willing to pay _some_ amount, the math ultimately didn't really work out. Specifically, net proceeds from the Kickstarter funded less than 5% of the _at cost_ work for Kalabox 2. To be clear, that miscalculation was totally on us and not all the great people and organizations who contributed to the campaign and to whom we remain eternally grateful. ;) Regardless, clearly not tenable.

After the Kickstarter we actually sold our equity in our first company, Kalamuna, to fund a year's worth of looking for a business model. Along the way we also turned down an offer for additional funding (more on that later). The highlights on models we either contemplated or tried during that year range from the obvious, to the, shall we say, interesting:

* A premium version of Kalabox
* Monthly support subscriptions
* On site trainings
* Whitelabeling
* Advertising
* Paid-for features and bug fixes
* A CI/CD/hosting service
* An Opt-in feature to let Kalabox mine Bitcoin on your machine for us (really proud of that one btw)

Needless to say none of the above were sufficient to sustain our costs. So, when the year was over we pivoted back to our bread and butter, running a digital agency, and [Tandem](https://thinktandem.io) was born. To this day Tandem's legal business name remains Kalabox Inc. and Kalabox's spiritual successor, Lando, remains without a business model.

## Challenging assumptions

In the aftermath of our failure to find a business model for Kalabox 2 we realized that _if_ there was a business model here it required a tool that could scale to more users, was less costly to develop and maintain and had the funding to scale up until a business model was RFO. (Real. Fucking. Obvious)

We resolved to continue the quest by first attacking the scale and cost problems. Done. Enter Lando, with _ten_ times the users of Kalabox 2 at _one half_ the development and maintainence cost. It's the Model 3 to our Model S. More on that [here](/2017/10/23/journey-lando/) if you're interested.

We further resolved to kick the can on the "business model" part of the equation until we reached 10,000 active monthly users mostly because, on some level, I don't think we _actually ever expected_ to get there...

Fast forward to six months ago and I'm at a bar, where all great ideas happen, looking over a cheap and neat double whiskey at my business partner Alec who utters: _ok, so, yeah, we got to 10,000, um, sort of fast, without, uh, basically any marketing_.

We spend the next few hours rehasing _all the old conversations_ we had years earlier when trying to build a business around Kalabox 2. How do we monetize? Do we try to raise money? What's the go to market strategy? Perhaps, most importantly, _how can we sustain the continued development and maintainence costs of this project as we continue to grow?_

We quickly realize that we've been this way before and while we are now better equipped the terrain looks _pretty much_ the same. Sadness. ;( Another drink. :beer: Frustration. :angry: More drinks. :beers: Then...

Then _The Question_.

> Why are we doing this?

It's really amazing to me how easy it is to forget why you are doing something. How easy it is to be captured and held hostage by what other people think you should be doing. It's even more embarrassing when you get convinced that these are actually _your own_ ideas that you then _believe for years._

Maybe we couldn't find a business model because there _shouldn't_ be a business model.

Why _are_ we doing this? To make money? Clearly not ;)

> It's because we give a shit.

When we first started making these kinds of tools it was to make our own and other developers lives easier. It was because we felt the pain of developer life and we wanted to help. Period. Full stop.

Along the way, however, we lost sight of this deeper truth, caught up in the shiny of marketing plans, business models and raising money. Now, freed from the mind-forged manacles we call the assumptions and expectations of others we recalculated.

1. If we give a shit about making developers lives easier then we need to be accountable to developers
2. If we need a business model then we are at worst accountable to shareholders and at best distracted from our primary mission in pursuit of dat cash
3. If we are willing to spend our own time and money helping make developers lives easier, then _there must be others_.

And that was it.

This isn't supposed to be a business! This is supposed to be a god damn fucking righteous movement! And with that the circle was now complete and [hope was (re)kindled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFo-XMUsy24). So we got right to work on...

## The Lando Alliance

_The Lando Alliance_ is a movement with a single purpose: to make developer's lives easier. Membership criteria is simple and straightforward.

> If you give a shit about developers and want to make their lives easier by giving some of your time or money then you should join.

_The Alliance_ encompasses **much more** than just Lando the local development tool, it is also...

* A [tech blog](https://blog.lando.dev) by and for professional developers
* A [Slack channel](https://launchpass.com/devwithlando) where developers can get help for _any_ of their dev problems
* A group of evangelists committed to making dev easier through [presentations and trainings](https://events.lando.dev)
* A place with helpful [guides](https://docs.lando.dev/guides/lando-info.html) and [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl_QBNuGJNoo7yH-n18K7Kg).
* A place for developers to find new work opportunities
* An advocacy group for developers.

You can think of it as both a developer's [Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)), doling out best in breed tools (or in some cases only in breed) so you can accomplish your current mission and their [Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oracle_(The_Matrix)), advising and guiding them in their fight against The Matrix.

Fundamentally, no business model and no funding means we answer to each other.

### Giving time

If you are intereseed
Each one of the bullet points above, and working on Lando itself, are

### Giving money



Lando, the open source tool you know and love is only a _small_ part of this mission



* lando is now mission critical for tons of people, what does that mean?
  * we need to be rolling out regular releaases because dev changes all the time, bugs, etc
  * we need to
  * return to the question: what is the business model?

* annouce the alliance
  * this is our solution, a platform for developers to help one another, a positive feedback loop where conntributions can
    * that in the short term:
      * can fund work on lando, provide support, help developers
    * that in the long term
      * can be a developer advocacy org
      * a place to go to get help with all your developer questions
      * a place that is making the tools you need
      * by, for and accountable to developers

* go over the programs
* call to action


> That's cool bro, but what's the business model?

The business model is _fuck off_ and let us work on what matters.
